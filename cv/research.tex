\section*{Research}

My research concerns teaching computers to learn efficiently about problems as complex as those involving understanding and manipulating human languages. To that end, I rely on strong results from probability theory, Bayesian statistics, formal languages and automata, optimisation, and linguistics. I develop machine learning models as well as techniques to estimate such models efficiently from data. Because the world only exposes partial supervision to its workings, my research has a strong component of unsupervised learning and other forms of latent variable modelling. 
I have a deep appreciation for Bayesian thinking and I am a firm believer in the role of explanations in science.
