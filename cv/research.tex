\section*{Research}

My research is focussed on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. To that end, I rely on strong results from probability theory, Bayesian statistics, optimisation, formal languages, and linguistics. I develop machine learning models as well as techniques to estimate such models efficiently from data. Because availability of supervision is a major bottleneck to statistical learning, my research has a strong component of unsupervised learning and other forms of latent variable modelling. 
I have a deep appreciation for Bayesian reasoning and I am a firm believer in the role of explanations in science.
