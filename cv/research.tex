\section*{Research}

My research is concerned with enabling computers to understand and process human languages. 
To that end, I rely on results from probability theory, Bayesian statistics, optimisation, formal languages, and linguistics. I develop machine learning models as well as techniques to estimate such models efficiently from data. Because availability of supervision is a major bottleneck to statistical learning, my research has a strong component of unsupervised learning and other forms of latent variable modelling.
